Since we have a fair launch on 21st of August 2021 we can not have a normal fair launch. In these days all projects are botted/sniped..
We have taken serious anti-bot/snipe measurements that can not be shared before the launch. 

Our contract is a fork of the Elongate contract. We improved it at 8 points. The contract will be shared at 3 PM UTC 21 August 2021.
We will lock the liquidity for a minimum of 1 year. After 9 months we have a date planned in the public app to decide about the years will we add to this lock.
In this way we keep it transparant and safe. Some time a go Pancakeswap switched from V1 to V2, all of the locked liquidity is lost because of the "100 year" locks.
We want to avoid these problems.

For the wallets we have we will use Multisig from Gnosis. All boardmembers will have a key to the wallet.
When someone wants to do a transaction you need a minimum of 75% of the keys to approve it.
In this way the wallets will be more safe for all of us.
